Look + Feel
~~~~~~~~~~~
        View aeroplane needs an image
        Select your seats needs an image
        Reorganize toolbar left hand links
        on the viewAeroplane page: Change text within text boxes to links for the viewFlight page
        add new css/html for the invoice page that makes the wizard icons not anchors
        the viewBooking page has a shit display format for the date/time



Bugs
~~~~
        the 'right chevron' on the paginator has the wrong page value. test with the viewBookings page.



Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        How to implement multistop?
        Search for, and implement, all the TODO comments
        Use that horrible looking mapping program for the web dev assignment
        Do not allow bookings if aeroplane is full
        Do not allow num passengers to be 6 if the aeroplane doesn't have 6 seats
        If it's a one-way trip, how does a rental car work? Considering it's priced 'per day'...
        if an existing booking is modified, should we generate a new invoice page?
        CTA buttons for empty lists?
        Change your seats for an existing booking
        Get the localhost URI out of the bookingAPI.js file?
        Don't allow a seat to be booked twice



Users
~~~~~
        Put a login guard in each page
        Display login info on each page
WIP     If no user token, then route to a 'please login' screen.
        Override the authorize.html page
        Pass the currently logged in user id to the create booking API
        Should not be showing other people's data. Need to compare against 'created_by' column/variable.
DONE    User sign in and sign out
        Create user?
        View/edit user?
        Delete user?
        clear session storage when not on a booking page



Refactoring
~~~~~~~~~~~
        refactor bookingApi.js
        refactor javascript that's currently within HTML into its .js files



Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~
        create docker file
        make sure the site works through docker image
